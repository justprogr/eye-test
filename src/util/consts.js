  dog: 'You have decent color vision. You see most of the sticks that are thrown to you but sometimes you\'re just lost.',
  cat: 'You have good color vision. The mice should hide when you\'re on the move.',
  tiger: 'Your color vision is superb. You wouldn\'t have any problems surviving in the jungle. You can see when the neighbouring tiger visits the bathroom faaaar away.',
  hawk: 'Wow, you have excellent color vision. You can see a worm from the top of a tree.'
